### ExternalLinkFinder

External links in a workbook, when broken, can cause the following errors:

1. This workbook contains links to other data sources
2. This workbook contains one or more links that cannot be updated

This code finds all external links, and records them in a summary sheet for the user

### PasswordBreaker

If a worksheet password in Excel 2010 or earlier is ever forgotten or unknown, this code will unlock
the spreadsheet. 

PasswordBreaker can be opened in a text editor (to be pasted into an Excel VBA module) or imported 
directly into an Excel file.
