### Boxplot Example

An example dataset and resulting boxplot for [TheNumberist](https://thenumberist.wordpress.com/2018/02/20/how-to-make-a-boxplot-in-excel/).

### ExternalLinkFinder

External links in a workbook, when broken, can cause the following errors:

1. This workbook contains links to other data sources
2. This workbook contains one or more links that cannot be updated

This code finds all external links, and records them in a summary sheet for the user

### LockBox

LockBox is a place to store encrypted passwords. All the encryption is done within the spreadsheet
itself, and it never stores the user's true passwords. The user only needs to remember one key for 
encrypting and decrypting. LockBox also has the ability to generate random passwords that adhere 
to user-defined parameters. And all of this is done without the use of macros, so it will even work
with Excel Online!

A more comprehensive explanation and walk-through can be found in the file itself.

DISCLAIMER: This personal project was created for my own curiosity and enjoyment. If you 
wish to store your passwords in an official capacity, please use a service such as 
[LastPass](https://www.lastpass.com/).
